<p>More information on each of the above criteria is below.</p>
<h3 id="project-idea">Project Idea</h3>
<p>Submit a half page proposal (50 - 100 words) describing the main idea behind your project. You should also include some information about what you intend to have in the different pages. </p>
<h3 id="project-media-sitemap">Project Media + Sitemap</h3>
<p>In your <code>project</code> folder create a separate sub-folder to collect the media you intend to include in your website. Media can be images, links to videos, audio files and content. You can paste the links in a MS-Word document or a regular text file. Some of the content that you find on the internet can be copyrighted so make sure you also save the source information.  </p>
<p>Submit a <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Site-Map-in-Microsoft-Word">Sitemap</a> for your project. Even though you only need 3 unique pages you can list more sub-pages as needed.</p>
<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
<p>These are the project blue prints. You will use these as guides to implement the web pages. There are vast number of tools you can use to create wireframes. We will talk more about wireframes during class starting around Week 4.
If you need inspiration try the following sites</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dribbble.com">dribbble.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://awwwards.com">awwwards</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v1-with-semantic-markup">v1 with Semantic Markup</h3>
<p>Semantic markup ensure search engines and bots can parse through your site content and identify imporant block. In this phase you are required to</p>
<ul>
<li>Create skeleton html pages with proper file names (1 point)</li>
<li>Include content in pages and markup using appropriate tags (3 points)</li>
<li>Verify the validity of HTML using <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a> (1 point)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="v2-using-basic-css">v2 using Basic CSS</h3>
<p>You can now start thinking about adding CSS to implement the wireframes. You will most likely be adding and/or removing HTML markup that you submitted previously. That is totally fine. Before you start including CSS it is recommended that you have</p>
<p>An idea of the color scheme you intend on using in the site. By the end of this phase your site should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All pages should have valid HTML markup</li>
<li>At least one of the pages should be responsive. </li>
<li>At least one of the pages should pass the accessibility test (Use the free WAVE Chrome Extension)</li>
</ul>
